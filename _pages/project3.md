# Description

In this project, we explore the usage of Single/Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning methods to address the vehicle rescheduling problem (Flatland Challenge),  solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse environments (MineRL: minecraft),  procedurally generated environment (Obstacle Tower). Another major outcome from this project is to participate in the corresponding challenges which happen annually.
