# Description

In this project, we explore the usage of Single/Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning methods to address the vehicle rescheduling problem (Flatland Challenge),  solve complex, hierarchical, and sparse environments (MineRL: minecraft),  procedurally generated environment (Obstacle Tower). Another major outcome from this project is to participate in the following challenges which happen annually as a part of research conferences.

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple)selection task. The task involves two parts: 
- Fill the missing portions of a starter code (each indicated with suitable comments and references to help easily find answers).
- Additional questions which are related to the project itself. There is no right or wrong answer to these questions and its basically to understand your thought process.

</h3>

> **TIP**: Deep Learning was invented to mimic how a neuron/human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. 
Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they **MUST** have some intuition backing them.

# Submission Deadline

Completed applications are to be submitted by **8th May 2021 11:59PM**!
