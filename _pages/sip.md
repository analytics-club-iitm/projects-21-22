    <center>[SIP]: Inventory Management</center>
</h1>

# Description

Inventory management in large companies in extremely difficult and if unoptimized can lead to losses of billions of dollars to companies. Given the various parameters which affect these decisions, manual management can  lead to incorrect decisions. In this project, we will explore the possibility of using AI based solutions (eg: RL algorithms) for aiding in the decision making task which can lead to cost saving. The applications of this technology is many, ranging from mess food management, handling the flow of itenary/funds within the IITM admin and all the way to large scale industries like ITC, Flipkart, Amazon, etc. Ref: [SIP submission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmMp1yISdtB8PTip8_hlukZH_QriEFVahRsdm7HDrts/)

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple)selection task. The task involves two parts: 
- Participate in a datascience competetion hosted by us for this particular task (one's rank in the contest does not affect the chances for getting selected). 
- Additionally, you are required to provide insights on the data provided in the form of graphs, etc.

> **TIP**: Data Science was modelled to mimic how a human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. 
Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they **MUST** have some intuition backing them.
