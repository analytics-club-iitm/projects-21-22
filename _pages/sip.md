</h1>

# Description

Inventory management in large companies in extremely difficult and if unoptimized can lead to losses of billions of dollars to companies. Given the various parameters which affect these decisions, manual management can  lead to incorrect decisions. In this project, we will explore the possibility of using AI based solutions (eg: RL algorithms) for aiding in the decision making task which can lead to cost saving. The applications of this technology is many, ranging from mess food management, handling the flow of itenary/funds within the IITM admin and all the way to large scale industries like ITC, Flipkart, Amazon, etc. Ref: [SIP submission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MmMp1yISdtB8PTip8_hlukZH_QriEFVahRsdm7HDrts/)
