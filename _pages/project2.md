<h1>
    <center>Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering</center>
</h1>

# Description

Multi-document question answering is a challenging problem because it demands understanding a noisy query, reasoning over multiple information sources, and explaining the answer prediction by providing supporting evidences. Given a query, the key parts of this project pipeline are - identify irrelevant documents, efficient parsing of related documents to identify relevant parts from them, and then finally predict answers with suitable explainations. Apart from raw performance, we will be focussing on efficiency and scalability across multiple languages (if possible).
