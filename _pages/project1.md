<h1>
    <center>AI for Social Good: Listen to See</center>
</h1>

# Description

An aid for visually impaired people to verbally visualize their surroundings. Given a frame/video sequence of a large scene, the AI must be able to explain the surroundings with sufficent context so that the person can move around. Beyond a social cause, it also helps dig deeper into open problems in Computer Vision - like capturing local context, temporal information across frames, handling different view points and occlusions. Further scope includes building a unified vision-language model which can also be utilized for various other downstream tasks.
