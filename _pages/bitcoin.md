# Description

Crytocurrency is becoming increasingly popular and its pseudonymity allows criminals to hide in plain sight. We aim to leverage the latest Machine Learning techniques to overcome Money Laundering. Specifically, we will focus on Graph Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc to predict illicit transactions using multiple features. Given limited research in this space, we would also like to build/simulate a synthetic dataset for future study.

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple)selection task. The task involves two parts: 
- Participate in a datascience competetion hosted by us for this particular task (one's rank in the contest does not affect the chances for getting selected). 
- Additionally, you are required to provide insights on the data provided in the form of graphs, etc.

</h3>

> **TIP**: Data Science was modelled to mimic how a human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. 
Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they **MUST** have some intuition backing them.

# Submission Deadline

Completed applications are to be submitted by **8th May 2021 11:59PM**!
