    <center>Diverse, Explainable Multi-hop Question Answering</center>
</h1>

# Description

Multi-document question answering is a challenging problem because it demands understanding a noisy query, reasoning over multiple information sources, and explaining the answer prediction by providing supporting evidences. Given a query, the key parts of this project pipeline are - identify irrelevant documents, efficient parsing of related documents to identify relevant parts from them, and then finally predict answers with suitable explainations. Apart from raw performance, we will be focussing on efficiency and scalability across multiple languages (if possible).

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple)selection task. The task involves two parts: 
- Fill the missing portions of a starter code (each indicated with suitable comments and references to help easily find answers).
- Additional questions which are related to the project itself. There is no right or wrong answer to these questions and its basically to understand your thought process.

> **TIP**: Deep Learning was invented to mimic how a neuron/human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. 
Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they **MUST** have some intuition backing them.
