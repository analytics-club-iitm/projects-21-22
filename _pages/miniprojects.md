Short term, quick outcome based projects spread across an entire year and selections for the same will be based on interaction and involvement in club sessions. *Eg: At the end of each session, we will be providing a questionaire only available to the live attendees. Based on one's responses and consistency across multiple sessions, we will be inviting them to participate in these projects.*

**NOTE: These projects are seperate and different from the year-long projects.**

        <td>
        In this project, we explore a unified model for translating multiple indic languages. 
        Some challenges in this task are: a unified representation across languages (eg: phonemes); handling low resource languages by modelling similarities with high resource ones, etc.
