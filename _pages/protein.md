    <center>3D Reconstruction of Protein Structures from Single/Multi-view Images</center>
</h1>

# Description

Protein structure is determined with the help of image microscopy (eg: Cryo-electron microscopy) at near atomic resolution. The main challenge here is to reconstruct the 3D structure of the macro molecule with noisy and randomly oriented projections. Deep Learning has shown tremendous success in computer graphics however is not much explored in the space of biology. If succesful, the impact of this project is going to be tremendous (Eg: [Alphafold2 hype](https://www.google.com/search?q=alphafold2&sxsrf=ALeKk03ALv09vpgQsORkhYQx1us7ang6MQ:1618735710614&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0sJC4tIfwAhXX4HMBHYgRDAwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=2488&bih=949)) and can inspire future research in this space.

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple)selection task. The task involves two parts: 
- Fill the missing portions of a starter code (each indicated with suitable comments and references to help easily find answers).
- Additional questions which are related to the project itself. There is no right or wrong answer to these questions and its basically to understand your thought process.

</h3>

> **TIP**: Deep Learning was invented to mimic how a neuron/human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. 
Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they **MUST** have some intuition backing them.

# Submission Deadline

Completed applications are to be submitted by **7th May 2021 11:59PM**!
