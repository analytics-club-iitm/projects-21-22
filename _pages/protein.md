# Description

Protein structure is determined with the help of image microscopy (eg: Cryo-electron microscopy) at near atomic resolution. The main challenge here is to reconstruct the 3D structure of the macro molecule with noisy and randomly oriented projections. Deep Learning has shown tremendous success in computer graphics however is not much explored in the space of biology. If succesful, the impact of this project is going to be tremendous (Eg: [Alphafold2 hype](https://www.google.com/search?q=alphafold2&sxsrf=ALeKk03ALv09vpgQsORkhYQx1us7ang6MQ:1618735710614&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi0sJC4tIfwAhXX4HMBHYgRDAwQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&biw=2488&bih=949)) and can inspire future research in this space.
